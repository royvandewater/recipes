# Chile Paste

## Ingredients

* 6 ancho, pasilla, or mulato chiles (about 1/2 oz). Seeded and torn into rough 1-inch pieces.
* 3 New Mexico red, California, costeño, or choricero chiles (about 1/8 oz). Seeded and torn into rough 1-inch pieces.
* 2 cascabel, árbol, or pequin chiles. Seeded and torn in half
* 2 cup low sodium chicken stock

## Instructions

1. Toast the dried chiles in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until
   slightly darkened, with an intense roasted aroma, 2 to 5 minutes; turn down the heat if 
   they begin to smoke. Add the chicken stock and simmer until the chiles have softened, 
   5 to 8 minutes.
2. Transfer the chiles and liquid to a blender and blend, starting on low speed and gradually 
   increasing the speed to high and scraping down the sides as necessary, until a completely 
   smooth puree is formed, about 2 minutes; add water if necessary if the mixture is too thick 
   to blend. Let cool.
3. Freeze the chile paste in ice cube trais, putting 2 tablespoons into each well. Once the 
   cubes are frozen, transfer to a zipper-ock freezer bag and store in the freezer for up 
   to 1 year.
